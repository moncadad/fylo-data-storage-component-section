## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Building the storage meter bar was such a pain I attempted all sorts of ways, and then I figure container within a container might just be an easy fix. Although it might result in not the most semantic solution. This is how I chose to problem solve.

I got a better understanding of linera gradient, ::after, and BEM.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue and make better use of gradient, ::after, BEM, and getting better at semantic HTML. In the future reworking this project by making it more dynamic could be pretty neat as well as making the buttons functional and directing that info to and from a database. I'm just saying would pretty darn cool!
